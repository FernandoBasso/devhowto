# HackerRank Problem Solving Challenges

In this section we attempt to explain approaches, reasoning and ideas for solving the [HackerRank problem solving challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms).

The goal is to have one ore more solutions for each challenge, using one or more programming paradigms (procedural, functional, whatever) as means of practicing and learning.

Making notes and creating explanations describing the techniques, concepts and steps used in a solution is a good way of understanding things better.

The source code for these solutions can be found in my [coding-studies](https://github.com/FernandoBasso/coding-studies).

:::{warning} About these solutions and explanations
Do not use these solutions (or others found in repositories over the web) on HackerRank.
Try solving them yourself and only then see how others have done it to try to learn from them and compare with your own solutions or attempts.

You don't learn by just copying code.
