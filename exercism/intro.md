# Exercism Challenges

It looks like Exercism tracks have the same challenge names for different languages.
Despite that, often what is asked in each challenge is a bit different for each language to cater for each language's features and idiomatic approaches.

## About the solutions

Sometimes there will be multiple solutions for the same problem.
The goal is to explore different approaches.
Maybe a solution will be more FPish and declarative, while another solution could be more imperative and procedural.

Maybe we'll try to make the code more elegant, or more performant.

Of course, sometimes the elegant solution is the more performant one, sometimes not.
It depends a lot on the problem at hand and the language being used.
